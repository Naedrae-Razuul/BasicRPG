# BasicRPG
First real project besides basic console programs. 
Very new to programming so forgive any newbie mistakes made in this project. 
Looking to improve so definitely comment on anything worth working on! :)

Currently NOT a balanced game. ( will be changing that in the future, though :) )

There is a 'give mula' button in the game. It was created for testing purposes.
Just ignore it.
